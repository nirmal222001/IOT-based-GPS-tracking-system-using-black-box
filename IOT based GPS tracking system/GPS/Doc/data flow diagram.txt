GPS Module: The GPS module receives signals from GPS satellites to determine the device's location.
Black Box: The black box records and stores data from various sensors on the device, such as acceleration, speed, and temperature.
Data Processor: The data processor analyzes the data from the GPS module and the black box, and sends the processed data to the database and the cloud server.
Database: The database stores the processed data, including location, speed, and other relevant information.
Cloud Server: The cloud server receives the processed data from the data processor, and provides real-time tracking information to the user interface.
User Interface: The user interface allows the user to track the device's location and view other relevant information, such as speed and temperature.
This data flow diagram shows the basic flow of data in an IoT-based GPS tracking system with a black box. The GPS module and black box collect data, which is processed by the data processor and stored in the database. The cloud server then provides real-time tracking information to the user interface, allowing the user to monitor the device's location and other relevant information.
