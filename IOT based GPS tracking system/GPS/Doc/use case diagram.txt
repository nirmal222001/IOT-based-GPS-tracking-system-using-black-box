In this diagram, the user interacts with the system by viewing the map to track the location of a vehicle equipped with a GPS tracker. They can also view the black box to access recorded data such as speed, location, and other vehicle-related information.

The user can track the vehicle by selecting it on the map, and the system will display its current location. The user can also access reports generated by the system based on the data collected from the GPS tracker and black box. These reports may include information about vehicle usage, maintenance, and other relevant data.

Finally, the user can receive alerts from the system when certain conditions are met, such as when the vehicle exceeds a predetermined speed limit or when it deviates from its expected route.

Overall, this use case diagram illustrates how an IoT-based GPS tracking system with a black box can help users monitor and manage their vehicles more effectively.
